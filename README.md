# web-traffic-insights
Website Performance Analytics is a full-scale data analysis project that explores user behavior, traffic sources, and engagement trends across digital channels. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the project cleans and validates raw web traffic data, then visualizes key insights such as:
Sessions and users over time: identifying growth patterns and peak activity periods.

Traffic by channel: comparing Direct, Organic Social, Search, Referral, Email, and Video sources.
Average engagement time: highlighting which channels drive deeper user interaction.
Engagement rate distribution: analyzing variability across traffic sources.
Engaged vs non-engaged sessions: measuring session quality and retention.
Hourly traffic heatmaps: uncovering when users are most active by channel.
Correlation between sessions and engagement: linking traffic volume with meaningful engagement.

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics workflow:
Data cleaning & validation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualization & storytelling
Actionable business insights for digital marketing optimization
